## Introduction

StreamsDB comes with a command line interface tool called sdbcli. The tool is distributed as a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/streamsdb/sdbcli).

## Prerequisite

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

## Installation

The easiest way to use the `sdbcli` docker image is to create an alias:

```bash
alias sdbcli='docker run --env="SDB_HOST=$SDB_HOST"
                         --volume="$HOME:/root/"
                         --network="host"
                         --interactive
                         --tty
                         --rm
                         streamsdb/sdbcli'
```

To keep aliases between sessions, you can save them in your userâ€™s shell configuration profile file. For example, `$HOME/.bashrc`, `$HOME/.zshrc` or `$HOME/.config/fish/config.fish` depending on your shell.

## Connection string

By default sdbcli will connect to a local instance of StreamsDB. You can change this behaviour by providing a [connection string](/docs/connection-string) to the `SDB_HOST` environment variable or set the `--host` flag.

### SDB_HOST

```bash
export SDB_HOST="sdb://username:password@us-west.streamsdb.io:443/database_name"
```

### --host flag

```bash
sdbcli --host="sdb://username:password@us-west.streamsdb.io:443/database_name" <COMMAND>
```

## Login

If the StreamsDB server or database requires authentication, you can specify a username and password in the [`connection string`](#connection-string] or use the login command.

The login command will authenticate with the provides username and password and store the authentication token on disk. The token stored on disk will be used for all subsequent commands till the logout command is used.

```bash
sdbcli login
```

The login command will ask for a username and password from stdin. For scripts we recommend to use a connection string with a username and password.

## Append to a stream

Use the `append` command to write event messages to a stream. Its syntax is `sdbcli append <STREAM> <EVENTTYPE> <VALUE>`.

The `<STREAM>` argument is the name of the stream, the `<EVENTTYPE>` argument is the name of the type of the event and the `<VALUE>` argument can either be a string value, or `-` to read from STDIN.

Here is an example that appends the message "HELLO WORLD from <user>" to the `welcom` stream:

``` BASH
sdbcli append welcome string "HELLO WORLD from $USER"
```

Alternatively you can use `-` to read from STDIN:

```bash
echo "HELLO WORLD from $USER" | sdbcli append welcome string
```

The append command prints the position of the written message.

## Reading from a stream

Use the `read` command to read from a stream. Its syntax is `sdbcli read <STREAM>`.

The `welcome` stream should have at least the event we just wrote to it. Lets query the last 10 events of the `welcome` stream to see it:

```bash
sdbcli read welcome
```

To specify a read position use the `--from` flag:

```bash
sdbcli read --from=5 welcome
```

To follow a stream use the `--follow` flag. This will prevent the read command to exit when there are no more messages available and will wait indefinitely for new messages to arrive.

```bash
sdbcli read --follow welcome
```

## List of streams

Use the `streams` command to list the streams in the database:

```bash
sdbcli streams
```
